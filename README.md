Security Vulnerability Dashboard
================================

This is a React-based dashboard application for visualizing and analyzing security vulnerability data from a large JSON file.

Setup Instructions
------------------

### 1\. Clone the repository

Clone the project to your local machine:

`git clone https://github.com/your-username/security-dashboard.git  cd security-dashboard   `

### 2\. Install dependencies

Install the required packages using npm:

`   npm install   `

### 3\. Download the JSON data file

Download the file ui\_demo.json from the following URL:

`   https://github.com/chanduusc/Ui-Demo-Data/blob/main/ui_demo.json   `

### 4\. Place the file in the public directory

After downloading, move ui\_demo.json into the public folder of the project. The final path should be:
